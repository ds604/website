We are looking for new and unexplored territory. Searching for hard problems

Discoveries synonymous with a legitimate effort to build math type understanding into 

(the culture.) our products?

Saying something that is new and structurally correct.

A production mindset to understand the problems

Build a company with a Pixar-like ethos.

A branch of the business will develop and sell unique artwork.

Potential clients: The development of such technology is relevant for banking, scientific, 

military applications and the fashion industry

Our Network:

We will develop, strengthen and enact strategic alliances with pre-existing business 

relationships. (More)

These include….

NYC Companies: New York Times Research Labs, Box, SVA, Framestore, NASA, Met 

Research

Meet-Ups: Bloomberg, NYC Machine Learning, Data Driven NYC, High Performance 

Computing, Python, Kitchen Table Coders,

Other: Deshaw Research, Z Sigma, The Mill – Will Robertson, Oha, Emily Baker,

Additional Statements:

We wish to create an ecosystem of standards and open-source software specifically built 

for exploratory work.

Where people are focused on data we want to focus on understanding. In this way the 

end user has access to something new.

We wish to do for the real world what Pixar did for computer graphics. (Stargies/plan for 

extending perceptual 3D to higher dimensional space)

We wish to create a hub that interacts with the data-science community. This includes 

education initiatives and using some tools of open-source community that act as a 

bridge.

The quality of intention we are putting into our research will have a tremendous impact in 

the power of emotion we are able to deliver.

Establish in concrete terms the relationship between: Maths – Art - World

Exploring problems from an art perspective that differentiates from a typical data 

science approach. i.e. the user experience gives people and the problems their trying 

to solve primary placement rather than focusing solely on technology. It is the notion of 

computing for people.

Building a supportive network - and being a resource to others - requires a new way of 

thinking. Instead of taking what gigs come along through word-of-mouth and hoping your 

income stays steady, it’s much better to plan ahead to build and nurture your network 

over time. The entire process is much more intentional than most freelancers are used to 

being.

How to see the world as one big networking opportunity after another, to see 

opportunities you would otherwise miss.

how to talk about ourselves without bragging, use social media without getting 

overwhelmed

How determined am I to see this succeed?

Am I willing to invest my own money and work long hours for no pay, sacrificing personal 

time and lifestyle, maybe for years?

What's going to happen to me if this venture doesn't work out?

If it does succeed, how many employees will this company eventually have?

What will be its annual revenues in a year? Five years?

What will be its market share in that time frame?

Will it be a niche marketer, or will it sell a broad spectrum of good and services?

What are my plans for geographic expansion? Local? National? Global?

Am I going to be a hands-on manager, or will I delegate a large proportion of tasks to 

others?

If I delegate, what sorts of tasks will I share? Sales? Technical? Others?

How comfortable am I taking direction from others? Could I work with partners or 

investors who demand input into the company's management?

Is it going to remain independent and privately owned, or will it eventually be acquired or 

go public?

1. Projected traffic. The most useful and standard projections estimate future unique 

visitors per month. Tracking this number over time is essential. Visits are also useful 

because the combination of visits and unique visitors is an indication of repeat visits, 

which can be an asset. Hits, as we used to call them in the 1990s (numbers of pages 

accessed and images viewed) are no longer a good measurement. Average time on site 

is also a useful indicator, especially when tracked over time.

2. Conversions. A conversion happens when a person browsing on the website chooses 

to subscribe. Conversions per visit for fremiums, which offer a free basic version of the 

product and for paid subscriptions are useful. Another useful projection is conversions 

from fremium to paid. 

3. Churn. The churn is an indicator of what percent of fremiums and what percent of paid 

subscribers drop out per month. Some calculate the average months instead, generating 

a lifetime value per customers. Those are just two sides of the same coin.

And along with these general traffic projections, here are some essential indicators of 

business flow and the underlying business model: 

4. Customer acquisition cost. This includes pay-per-click and other marketing efforts 

averaged out over paying customers. Divide your sales and marketing costs by the 

number of customers. That’s your customer acquisition costs. 

5. Lifetime value of a customer. This is closely related to churn. Multiply your average 

revenue per subscriber per month by the average number of months that a subscriber 

stays. 

6. Burn rate. This is an estimate of how much money it takes, per month, to stay in 

business. Include salaries, overhead, marketing, etc. Normally a burn rate changes as 

the business evolves. 

7. Runway. This is stated in months, as in "how many months of burn rate are in the 

cash balance." We call this runway, as in “we have a runway of nine months.” 

8. Revenues. The sales forecast should already show revenues. I add it here because 

it’s an important and extremely useful indicator of business size and flow. It doesn’t 

include investment or loans, but does include shipping, subscriptions, sales and service 

revenues. This is simply a projection of how much money you bring in every month.
